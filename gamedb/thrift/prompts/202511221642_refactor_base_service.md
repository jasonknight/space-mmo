In py/services/base_service.py there are many string templates of JSON code. in py/services create a new directory snippets/ and for each JSON code example in base_service.py create a new snippets/<name>.json file and replace the code in base_service.py to load the snippet.
If you are unclear on any point, ask for clarification.
